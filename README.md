# 🌐 My HTML Projects

Welcome to my collection of **HTML files** created while learning and practicing web development. These files demonstrate my understanding of how to structure web pages using semantic HTML elements. The projects range from basic page layouts to more advanced form designs and static templates.

This work was developed as part of my journey with the **App and Web Development Club at KGRCET** and includes real examples used during practice sessions and workshops.
